todo.txt - 17% as powerful as JIRA

* BUG: Don't let the shape be moved after the instant-drop command
* BUG: Fix the bug when you rotate a shape on the edge of the grid causing a collision (allow "wall kicks")
* Use a build tool to concat + minify the JavaScript
* Show the 'next up' shape

* High Scores
* Dynamically re-size the canvas to match the browser size
* Test on mobile, implement correct scaling and touch controls
* Redesign the look & feel - make the background lighter, make the drop shadow lighter, make it more obvious once the shape has 'locked' into its final position (make it darker? Border change?)

MAYBE
=====
* Implement speed-drop (holding down a button speeds up the rate at which the shape drops (for bonus points))
